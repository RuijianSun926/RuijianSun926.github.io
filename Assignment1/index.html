        <h4 class="center with-margin1 color-white">The website I have chosen for my research is https://palat2023.com/</h4>
        
        <h2 class="center with-margin2 rubik-scribble-regular color-white">Week 2</h2>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">When I first entered the webpage, the color changes caused by my mouse movement attracted me. I realized this was not just a showcase page, but a web page that combines rich interaction, with each color change bringing visual feedback and text changes, which also stimulated my interest to continue exploring.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">I was first drawn to the intro page by the color changes, then the rotation of the triangles and the movement of the text. I specifically stopped to move the mouse back and forth over the image to observe the diffusion and contraction of the pixelated pattern, exploring the visual effects each interaction brought. I also tried different mouse movement speeds to see if this would change the response of the animations.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple"> What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white"> I spent a lot of time on the last part of the text, the text animation interaction particularly attracted me. The change of color, the exchange of text, and the breathing light effect of the arrows and text all interested me, and I repeated the actions many times to observe each detail of the smooth animation effects.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">The most common action was moving the mouse, not just to trigger animation effects, but also because each movement brought me a sense of novelty. Each interaction was accompanied by new visual feedback, which also made me want to keep experiencing.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">The interactive design of this webpage made me feel that its primary goal is to showcase the exquisite technology and unique design. Each meticulously crafted animation conveyed an ultimate pursuit of creativity and design.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">The interactive experience conveyed its main objective through unique animations and visual styles. Whether it was the interaction of colors, the smoothness of animations, or the harmony of the overall design, every element demonstrated the designer's sophistication intended to be showcased through web design.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? </h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">The website seems to expect users to explore and experience repeatedly. I expect to revisit many times due to continuously discovering new animations and details.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple"> How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin3 single-day-regular color-white">The interactive animations retain enough appeal, the animations' simplicity, fluidity, and creativity make people want to trigger them again, unable to resist watching several times. This design also entices users to maintain long-term interaction and participation.</p>
        
        <h2 class="center with-margin2 rubik-scribble-regular color-white">Week 3</h2>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">The website seems to have been inspired by traditional pixel art and modern dynamic graphic design. The pixelated patterns and animated effects reminded me of a combination of retro video games and modern digital art.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">I think the design of this webpage conveys an expectation: hoping users will actively participate, interact with different page elements, and explore the design concept behind each animation, rather than passively browse.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple"> What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">The whole webpage gave me the feeling that design can be vivid, interactive, and even fun. They remind me that as a participant, I can enjoy the process and expect surprises in every corner. I feel like I am talking to a designer who knows how to break the routine and create fun.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">Sometimes when I just want to quickly obtain certain information, various animation effects delay my reading process. Even if the animation effects are short, the repeated stacking of animations makes me feel a bit messy.</p>
        <h3 class="center color-purple">What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        <p class="center with-margin2 single-day-regular color-white">What I am most satisfied with is the designer's meticulous attention to each animation effect. I really like to observe some details in the design. Many animations on this webpage contain details that need to be carefully observed to be discovered, such as the breathing effect of the font, the color changes similar to the breathing lamp. This has impressed me with the creativity of the designer. This interactivity and visual creativity make the whole experience very complete.</p>
