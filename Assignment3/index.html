<!--For this A3 assignment, I chose to design a jigsaw puzzle game. 
Due to the current environmental destruction and excessive hunting, 
approximately 70 animal species disappear from the Earth every day, and about 3 species are labeled as extinct every hour.
This planet should also belong to them. After combining this with my presentation, I decided to iterate on my concept. 
Therefore, I decided to link my puzzle content with the protection of animals, allowing users to better understand and pay attention to the world's rare and protected animals.

This assignment was completed with the help of YouTube creator Crypters Infotech's 
"Jigsaw Puzzle using jQuery UI draggable and droppable Interactions (Part 1-Part 8)" tutorial videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mgsMcOwfoE&t=2s-->

<!-- To achieve my concept, I chose 16 representative endangered animals and arranged them in a 4x4 square puzzle.
These animals are (from top to bottom, left to right): 
Platypus, Red Panda, Orange-bellied Parrot, Koala, 
Sea Turtles, Polar Bear, African Elephant, Varanus komodoensis, 
Panda, Black Rhino, Quokka, Siberian Tiger, 
Lemurs, Golden Snub-nosed Monkey, Chinese Alligator, and Snow Leopard. 
The ultimate goal of the puzzle is to form an image of the Earth, symbolizing that only by bringing these animals together can we have a complete planet.

All animal images on the website are sourced from iStock, Unsplash, and Pixabay. The Earth image was drawn using Adobe Illustrator. -->

<!-- During the image creation phase, I mentioned in the last class that I wanted to use a website to automatically generate a mosaic image, but the effect was not good. 
Since I chose 16 animals, using the website's auto-generation feature would require at least hundreds of images to ensure there are no duplicates, and the images would be very small, 
making it difficult to observe the animals in each piece. This was not the effect I wanted. Therefore, I used Photoshop to arrange the 16 images in a large square. 
I considered the composition of each image to determine its position in the large square for example, I placed the platypus in the upper left corner according to the direction of the image. 
For the final complete puzzle of the Earth image, I used Illustrator. I chose to draw the Atlantic side of the Earth because if I chose the other side (with Asia as the main part), 
a large green area would be covered in the image, and the right side of the Pacific would have too much blank space, making the overall image distribution uneven. 
Therefore, I chose to draw the Atlantic side in the center, which not only achieves a balanced left and right composition but also ensures that almost all animal images can be displayed more clearly.-->

<!-- After completing the basic operations, I set up a reset button. This button allows the puzzle pieces to be randomly repositioned each time the page is refreshed,
which I hope will reduce the feeling of repetition when the webpage is opened multiple times. -->

    <button id="reset" class="reset-style">Reset</button>

    <script src="script.js"></script>


    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
            document.getElementById("reset").click();
        });
    </script>

</body>

</html>

<!-- Reflecting on the process, I must admit that even though it took a lot of my time, there are still some issues with the final interaction that I couldn't resolve.
For example, I wanted the puzzle piece to return to its original position when moved to the wrong location, but there is a chance it will fail and move to another position. 
Sometimes, when moving a piece incorrectly, it may suddenly disappear. This is actually because the piece has moved to a lower layer beneath other pieces. 
This assignment was very challenging for me because I was learning something completely new from scratch. 
However, I believe this is a great start that will give me a better foundation for future projects.-->
